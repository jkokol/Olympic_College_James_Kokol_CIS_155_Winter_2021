        <li>Overall, with the CSS, I tried to keep the page looking clean, while also reaching the requirements for the page</li>
        <li>The main page, later on, is going to link to various articles that will talk about a powerful deck from the past, how it functions, and why it is so powerful. Additonally, I will attempt to recreate the deck today, with current cards</li>
        <li> Right now, it is just a main page, with some images and some basic CSS</li>

        <li>Notes: I feel much happier with this version of the webpage</li>
        <li>While I couldn't add any articles this time (Research of past tournament wins is actually pretty hard), the overall look and feel of the website is better</li>
        <li>In the next version, however, I do want to find a way to make the buttons centered in the image, and move the description text to the right of the image</li>
        <li>Maybe work on the images overall...</li>
