    <h2>Abzan Midrange: Carried on Rhinoback</h2>
    <p id="one">
        The Year is 2014. Wizards of the Coast had just released their newest set, Khans of Tarkir, to the masses. While
        everyone was building constructed decks around things like the consistant Jeskai Ascendancy or the Aggressive
        Mantis Rider, one card in particular got a majority of the attention from those who wanted to make meta decks.
        That card in particular was, of course... Treasure Cruise, but Siege Rhino was a close second.

    </figure>
    <h2>The Rhino</h2>
    <p id="one">
        At a glance, Siege Rhino may seem like a simple enough card. On its own, it represents 3 health gain, 3 health
        lost, and a powerful 4/5 body. But, at least for this standard meta, thats all the Rhino needed to do. The
        amount of pure value you get by playing a rhino is, frankly, a little absurd. And with four of them in your
        deck, you weren't running out of fuel any time soon.
    </p>
    <h2>The Abzan Houses</h2>
    <p id="one">At the same time, we can't forget the other powerful cards within Abzan Midrange that allowed for this
        deck to go down in history. This includes cards like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li type="circle">Wingmate Roc, The 5 Mana Flying Bird that summons another Flying Bird.</li>
        <li type="circle">Abzan Charm, A swiss Army Knife that gives card advantage, or straight up destruction.</li>
        <li type="circle">Anafenza, A card that keeps powerful graveyard cards out of your opponent's graveyard.</li>
        <li type="circle">Fleecemane Lion, released later on, works as a powerful early game card for the deck.</li>
    </ul>

        This, overall, made for a powerful deck that kept themselves alive, kept resources out of the opponent's
        control, and filled the board with powerful creatures. It represents midrange in its most powerful form, with
        many strengths, and very, very few weeknesses.</p>

                A Good example of a Abzan Midrange deck at full power. Hangerback walker is used as more raw power, and
                Many of the other cards here are used for removal. Additional Wingmate Rocs are in the Sideboard, and is
                exchanged
                for matchups that work best with tokens, along with cards like Duress, Silkwrap, and Ultimate Price. In
                general, just play a standard midgame play, using Rhinos, Wardens, and Rocs to setup and be agressive,
                and Anafenza and Hangarback to control and finish the opponent off.
